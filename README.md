### Hi! I'm Suha 🌼👋
I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Software Engineering.

💡 I enjoy problem solving, collaborating in teams, and being a leader. I thrive in environments where I can express myself creatively and explore different problems.

🗺️ In the future, I see myself working in video game companies or tackling problems in cybersecurity.

📚 In my free time, I enjoy playing my lyre, creating pixel embroidery, tackling Hack The Box problems, or creating 3D models!

⏲️Current Obsession: **Cybersecurity**
